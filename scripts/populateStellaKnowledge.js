Special attention must be paid to calcium intake (1000-1200mg daily) and vitamin D (800-1000 IU daily) to combat bone density loss. Food items are selected based on shelf stability, packaging efficiency, and minimal crumb production. Hydration requirements increase to 2-3 liters daily due to the fluid shifts experienced in microgravity.",

The SMART protocol (Stress Management and Resilience Training) shows 35% improvement in astronaut psychological outcomes. For missions exceeding 6 months, quarterly psychological evaluations are conducted using the Astronaut Psychological Evaluation Toolkit (APET), measuring stress tolerance, group dynamics, and cognitive function under isolation.",

Unlike Earth fires, space fires spread spherically due to lack of convection currents in microgravity. Primary suppression uses CO2-based systems that reduce oxygen without harming electronics.
